# File Upload Project

<p>
This Golang application provides endpoints for uploading, listing and downloading files into a disk space
</p>

<p>
There is no external dependency. Hence, the application can be cloned and run(* assuming you have go installed on your pc *) via ```go run main.go ```
</p>

the upload endpoint is at: http://localhost:8080/static/index.html

the listing of files endpoint: http://localhost:8080/files

I struggled with both the logic and endpoint creation for download.
